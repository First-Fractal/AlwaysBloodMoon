Always Blood Moon is a simple mod that makes every night a Blood Moon night.
There is a config option to make the Solar Eclipse appear every day after any mech has been defeated.
There's another config option to dislay the amount of Blood Moons/Solar Eclipses that has appear in that world.

The idea for this mod is from Pleco. I just coded it.
If you are a Terraria Content Creator that is going to use this mod, please give me proper credit by mention that I was the one who made it, and that you link my channel (https://www.youtube.com/@first_fractal), mod, or website (https://firstfractal.com) in the description.
