# Always Blood Moon
Always Blood Moon is a simple mod that makes every night a Blood Moon night.
There is a config option to make the Solar Eclipse appear every day after any mech has been defeated.
There's another config option to dislay the amount of Blood Moons/Solar Eclipses that has appear in that world.
